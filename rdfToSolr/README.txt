This directory contains a java project for a configurable
program to query bib record in RDF to build Solr documents.

This is designed to work agains RDF generated by 
voyager-to-vitroTriples.datamap.xsl and to generate
Solr documents in blacklight compatible format.

CmdLineRecordToDocument will index a single document.

StdinRecordToDocument will accept a list of URLs on stdi 
and index those documents.  stdinRecordToDocument.sh is a 
script that will run this.

RecordToDocumentMARC defines the queries and conversion.
