Welcome to the Discovery & Access Solr Index Build

This is a sub-project of Cornell's Discovery & Access, with
a focus on building Solr indexes, primarily but not exclusively
from catalog data.

The primary method for execution of pieces of this project
is through gradle. Execute "gradle tasks" to retrieve library
jars used by the project and to get a list of available tasks.
